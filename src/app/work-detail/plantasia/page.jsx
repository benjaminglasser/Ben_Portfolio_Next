            My initial idea was to use piezo touch sensors as a way to drive the

            up to my plant to see how the interaction felt

            Before connecting it to processing, I hooked up a simple piezo
            speaker to test out the system. I started to become hesitant about
            using piezo touch sensors for this instrument as they wouldn't
            trigger the note reliably which is an important aspect of music
            creation

        description={`While researching this project, I stumbled across a capacitive touch breakout board built for arduino that seemed like it may be a more reliable alternative and, if it worked correctly, would include the plant into the system more directly rather than being more of an illusion gimmick.

      <p className="px-5 mt-5 md:px-10 ">
        First, I needed to test if my plant would function well as a capacitive
        sensor:

        />
      </div>
      <p className="px-5 mt-5 md:px-10 ">
        With the succesful first test, I decided to move forward with this
        build. Due to the fact that the breakout board allowed for multiple
        connections via one data stream, It was relatively straightforward to
        connect more inputs to communicate with processing. I built out a basic
        synth in processing that would randomly cycle through various octaves
        per note trigger to create an ambient but musical interaction

        Instead of having the octaves jump around randomly, I felt it would be
        more playable to put the octave control onto a slider as well as give
        the user attack and release controls on a knob. Enter the multiple
        serial communication basics!

        description="This was a very exciting and useful project for myself. Getting to bring my background in music into this instrument was a very fun and rewarding way to apply some basic yet important hardware principles all together in one unified project. I would like to expand on the idea by adding more notes to make up a full 12 note scale, restricting to specific keys, and synthesizing a more unique sound rather than a simple sine wave (Which I will admit does work well with the plant theme as is). I look forward to utilizing these tools in future projects!."
